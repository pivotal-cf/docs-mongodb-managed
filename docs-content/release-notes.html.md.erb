### v1.2.7

**Release Date**: Spetember 18, 2020

* Update base stemcell to address <a href="https://github.com/10gen/ops-manager-cloudfoundry/issues/70">https://github.com/10gen/ops-manager-cloudfoundry/issues/70</a>

### v1.2.6

**Release Date**: April 22, 2020

* Tightened up string handling logic in the config agent default configuration template. This addresses possible corruption of deployments created with older version of the tiles. In some rare cases, internal identifiers comprised of random strings will incorrectly cast to numerics by the go-lang and Ruby templating system in the Tile SDK. These deployments may fail to function properly.

### v1.2.5

**Release Date**: April 17, 2020

* Added support for VMware PCF 2.8
* Added support for MongoDB Ops Manager 4.2
* Fixed multiple issues in which the Config Agent wasn't able to synchronize automation agent configuration upon startup and during upgrades.
* Fixed in issue where the unbind operation for a service binding was failing.
* Exposed `max_in_flight` and `canaries` parameters in tile configration.

**Compatibility Warning**

Ops Manager 4.2 Global and Programatic apikey are <b>not</b> supported at this time. Only legacy apikey are supported.

### v1.2.4

**Release Date**: January 31, 2020

* Patched name generation for MongoDB Ops Manager projects and organizations to respect proper formatting.
* Fixed an issue where existing MongoDB Ops Manager projects we're unable to upgrade.
* Updates and enhancements to CI/CD pipelines.

### v1.2.3

**Release Date**: January 15, 2020

* Fixed the name of a Bosh Release item to not collide with other tiles. The recent enhancement with VMware Tanzu 2.7 and BPM support introduced new components to the MongoDB Tile of which a `bosh` release name collision could occur. This has been corrected in this release.
* Updated Bosh On-Demand Service Broker to v0.34.1 which contains update to Go language to address several CVEs.  

### v1.2

**Release Date**: December 20, 2019

* The tile has been updated so that automation agent processes on MongoDB vms are now monitored by `monit` rather than `monit` monitoring the `mongod` processes directly. Operators should expect the corresponding changes in the monitoring reports from vms.
* Updated and ehananced MongoDB deployement configuration merging and management between the VMware Tanzu Service Broker and MongoDB Ops Manager.
* Added support for VMware Tanzu 2.7
* Additional various bug fixes

### v1.1.3

* Fixing issue with MongoDB Agent write permissions to local volumes that prevent automated update.
* Removing quota limit of 10 sharded cluster deployments. 
* OSB Binding command includes url parameter that contains sample of a connection string. Note: Connection string should be built separately to ensure correct connection for each individual case.
* Added additional error resolution for Service Instance upgrade. When MongoDB cluster configuration cannot be modified by Tile, Ops Manager will revert it to a latest known working configuration in order to avoid service downtime.  


### v1.1.1

**Release Date**: July 11, 2019

### v1.0.12
**Release Date**: November 2, 2018

This release of the MongoDB Enterprise Service for VMware Tanzu tile contains
bug fixes and the following new features:

* **Enable SSL/TLS by default for all MongoDB deployments:** A new tile-level configuration parameter is available
    to force all MongoDB deployments created with the tile to have SSL/TLS network connections enabled by default.
    This setting is available on the **MongoDB On-Demand** tab of the tile configuration in VMware Tanzu Ops Manager.

* **Validate MongoDB version** The tile now proactively validates the version of MongoDB requested
    for a deployment and issues an error before beginning the provisioning. 

* **XFS** Base operating system environments targetted for MongoDB deployments now mounts data directories with the XFS filesystem.
    This is in line with MongoDB recommended [production notes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/production-notes/#kernel-and-file-systems).

* **Syslog** The MongoDB tile now supports standard VMware Tanzu tile syslog aggregation for all managed resources. 

* **MongoDB Ops Manager 4.0.4** The tile has been tested and certified with MongoDB Ops Manager 4.0.4.

**Known Issues**:

* GCP environments running VMware Tanzu are not supported due to an issue with the Ubuntu Trusty stemcell series.
  See [bosh/issues/1722](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh/issues/1722).

### v1.0.5

**Release Date**: July 5, 2018

This incremental release of our tile contains the following:

* **SSL/TLS support for MongoDB deployments:** The service broker now supports fully configuring the TLS settings for a MongoDB deployment through the MongoDB Ops Manager API. This removes the need to complete TLS configuration manually through the MongoDB Ops Manager web console.

* The dependency on BOSH DNS is now optional (required for SSL/TLS support). Note, this was added to version v1.0.4 but never made publicly available.

### v1.0.3

**Release Date**: April 17, 2018

This incremental release of our tile contains the following:

* **SSL/TLS support for MongoDB deployments:** You can now deploy MongoDB on VMware Tanzu with TLS/SSL enabled. A new security section has been added to the tile configuration which allows setting the required certificates and private keys. Additional configuration on MongoDB Ops Manager is required to fully enable TSL/SSL connections to MongoDB deployments. See [Enabling SSL for a Deployment](https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment/) for more information.

* **T-shirt sizing for MongoDB deployments:** This new feature expands the number of service plans available for users. VMware Tanzu operators can now define Small, Medium, and Large plans for each of the three deployment types (Standalone, Replica Set, and Sharded Cluster). Each size and cluster-type pair allows a choice of both VM-type and storage disk type.</p>

* **Automatically enable backups for MongoDB clusters foundry-wide:** The tile configuration allows you to enable backups by default for all MongoDB clusters provisioned. This setting does not effect existing clusters. For those, use MongoDB Ops Manager to configure backups.
