### v1.0.3

**Release Date**: April 17, 2018

This incremental release of our tile contains the following:

* **SSL/TLS support for MongoDB deployments:** You can now deploy MongoDB on PCF with TLS/SSL enabled. A new security section has been added to the tile configuration which allows setting the required certificates and private keys. Additional configuration on MongoDB Ops Manager is required to fully enable TSL/SSL connections to MongoDB deployments. See [Enabling SSL for a Deployment](https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment/) for more information.

* **T-shirt sizing for MongoDB deployments:** This new feature expands the number of service plans available for users. PCF operators can now define Small, Medium, and Large plans for each of the three deployment types (Standalone, Replica Set, and Sharded Cluster). Each size and cluster-type pair allows a choice of both VM-type and storage disk type.</p>

* **Automatically enable backups for MongoDB clusters foundry-wide:** The tile configuration allows you to enable backups by default for all MongoDB clusters provisioned. This setting does not effect existing clusters. For those, use MongoDB Ops Manager to configure backups.
