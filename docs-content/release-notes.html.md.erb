### v1.0.3

**Release Date**: April 1, 2018

This incremental release of our tile contains the following:

* SSL/TLS support for MongoDB deployments
<p>MongoDB deployments on PCF can now be deployed with TLS/SSL 
enabled. A new security section has been added to the tile 
configuration which allows setting the required 
certificates and private keys. Please note, additional configuration
on MongoDB Ops Manager is required to fully enable TSL/SSL connections
to MongoDB deployments. See the official documentation on 
[enabling SSL for a deployment]
(https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment/) 
for more information.

* T-Shirt sizing for MongoDB deployments
<p>This new feature expands the number of service plans 
available for users. PCF Operators can now define Small,
Medium, and Large plans for each of the three deployment types
(Standalond, Replica Set, and Sharded Cluster). Each size and
cluster-type pair allows a choice of both VM-type and storage
disk type.</p>

* Automatically enable backups for MongoDB clusters
foundry-wide
<p>The tile configuration allows for backups to be enabled
by default for all MongoDB clusters provisioned. This setting
does not effect existing clusters. For those, use MongoDB
Ops Manager to configure backups.</p>
