### v1.0.12
**Release Date**: November 2, 2018

This release of the MongoDB Enterprise Service for VMware Tanzu tile contains
bug fixes and the following new features:

* **Enable SSL/TLS by default for all MongoDB deployments:** A new tile-level configuration parameter is available
    to force all MongoDB deployments created with the tile to have SSL/TLS network connections enabled by default.
    This setting is available on the **MongoDB On-Demand** tab of the tile configuration in VMware Tanzu Ops Manager.

* **Validate MongoDB version** The tile now proactively validates the version of MongoDB requested
    for a deployment and issues an error before beginning the provisioning. 

* **XFS** Base operating system environments targetted for MongoDB deployments now mounts data directories with the XFS filesystem.
    This is in line with MongoDB recommended [production notes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/production-notes/#kernel-and-file-systems).

* **Syslog** The MongoDB tile now supports standard VMware Tanzu tile syslog aggregation for all managed resources. 

* **MongoDB Ops Manager 4.0.4** The tile has been tested and certified with MongoDB Ops Manager 4.0.4.

**Known Issues**:

* GCP environments running VMware Tanzu are not supported due to an issue with the Ubuntu Trusty stemcell series.
  See [bosh/issues/1722](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh/issues/1722).

### v1.0.5

**Release Date**: July 5, 2018

This incremental release of our tile contains the following:

* **SSL/TLS support for MongoDB deployments:** The service broker now supports fully configuring the TLS settings for a MongoDB deployment through the MongoDB Ops Manager API. This removes the need to complete TLS configuration manually through the MongoDB Ops Manager web console.

* The dependency on BOSH DNS is now optional (required for SSL/TLS support). Note, this was added to version v1.0.4 but never made publicly available.

### v1.0.3

**Release Date**: April 17, 2018

This incremental release of our tile contains the following:

* **SSL/TLS support for MongoDB deployments:** You can now deploy MongoDB on VMware Tanzu with TLS/SSL enabled. A new security section has been added to the tile configuration which allows setting the required certificates and private keys. Additional configuration on MongoDB Ops Manager is required to fully enable TSL/SSL connections to MongoDB deployments. See [Enabling SSL for a Deployment](https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment/) for more information.

* **T-shirt sizing for MongoDB deployments:** This new feature expands the number of service plans available for users. VMware Tanzu operators can now define Small, Medium, and Large plans for each of the three deployment types (Standalone, Replica Set, and Sharded Cluster). Each size and cluster-type pair allows a choice of both VM-type and storage disk type.</p>

* **Automatically enable backups for MongoDB clusters foundry-wide:** The tile configuration allows you to enable backups by default for all MongoDB clusters provisioned. This setting does not effect existing clusters. For those, use MongoDB Ops Manager to configure backups.
