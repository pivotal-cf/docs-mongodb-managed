##<a id='install'></a> Install and Configure the MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF Tile

1. Download the product file from [Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file. 

1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF tile
   in the Ops Manager **Available Products** view to add it to your staging area.

1. Click the newly added **MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF** tile.

1. For **MongoDB Ops Manager URL**, enter the URL of your MongoDB Ops Manager web interface.

1. For **MongoDB Ops Manager username**, enter the MongoDB Ops Manager username 
   that PCF will use to create MongoDB instances.
   The user must have sufficient permissions to create a cluster.

1. For **MongoDB Ops Manager API key**, enter the key associated with your MongoDB account.
1. Optionally, enable backups through MongoDB Ops Manager by selecting
the **Backups enabled by default** check-box.

1. Add one or more **Tags** to automatically apply to each cluster
deployed through PCF. These tag are accessable in MongoDB Ops Manager.
They can be used to help distunguish PCF-based deployments from 
other deployments in MongoDB Ops Manager.

1. For **MongoDB availability zone(s)**, select the checkboxes that correspond to the availability zones where you want to deploy MongoDB.
   The availability zones must have an associated service network.

1. Click **Save**.  

1. For each of the **Service Plan** sections, configure the 
**Small**, **Medium**, and **Large** **VM Type**'s and 
and **disk type**'s.

1. Click **Save** for each.

1. Optionally, configure the **Security** settings.
<p>This section allows you to configure TSL/SSL settings for your MongoDB deployments.
By default, all deployments have MongoDB authetication enabled and dealing with 
these settings are only required to support TSL/SSL communication between 
applications and MongoDB databases. 
<p>Enter a server certificate and private key PEM file. 
The server certificate will be placed on each MongoDB 
virtual machine at `/var/vcap/jobs/mongod_node/config/server.pem`.
Then, enter the Certificate Authority (CA) server certificate. 
This will be placed in `/var/vcap/jobs/mongod_node/config/cacert.pem`.
<p>Note, these settings only configure the placement of the certificates 
on the provisioned machines running MongoDB. In order to actually 
enable SSL communication it is neccessary to complete the configuration
in the corresponding Project Security settings in MongoDB Ops Manager. 
Please see the documentation on [enabling ssl for a deplopyment](https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment/) for fully detailed 
documentation on these steps.

1. Optionally, configure the **Errands**, **Resource Config**, and
**Stemcell** sections.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to install the MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF tile and wait for the
installation to complete.

1. Log in to MongoDB Ops Manager and add the PCF Ops Manager IP Address to the API whitelist;
   For more information, see [MongoDB Ops Manager Documentation](https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/tutorial/configure-public-api-access/).

1. After the installation finishes, see [Creating and Binding MongoDB Service Instances](binding.html)
   for how to create and bind MongoDB service instances.

## <a id="troubleshoot"></a> Troubleshooting

This section describes how to troubleshoot known issues when installing the MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF tile.

###Symptom###

MongoDB Ops Manager is not found.

### Explanation###

The problem may be produced by one of the following causes:

* MongoDB Ops Manager is not reachable.
* MongoDB Ops Manager API is not enabled.
* MongoDB Ops Manager API key is invalid.

### Solution ###

Perform the following solutions to fix the problem:

* Ensure that MongoDB Ops Manager is running and reachable across the network.
* Navigate to **Group Settings** in MongoDB Ops Manager and ensure that **Public API** is enabled.
* Ensure that the MongoDB Ops Manager API key you provided when configuring the tile is valid.
  If not, navigate to **Group Settings** in MongoDB Ops Manager and generate a new one.

###Symptom###

Undetermined error.

### Explanation###

Various error can occur due to misconfiguration, networking
issue, or other problems.

### Solution ###

Check logs for errors.
* From the PCF-side you can find logs in the 
`/var/vcar/sys/log` directory.

* Find the task id of your provisioning job from the 
output of the `bosh tasks` command. You can then view logs from
the task with the command `bosh task <TASK_ID>`.

* On your Ops Manager machine, depending on your installation
method, logs can be found in:

    * For achive installs: `<ARCHIVE_DIR>/logs`
    * For package manager installs: `/var/log/mongodb-mms`
