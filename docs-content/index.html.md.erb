This documentation describes the MongoDB Enterprise Service for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).
The MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF tile registers a service broker on PCF and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace.
Those plans are integrated with <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/products/ops-manager">MongoDB Ops Manager</a>.
Developers can provision MongoDB databases by creating instances of the service plans using Apps Manager
or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

The MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF has the following key features:

* The ability to provision a MongoDB service instance in standalone, replica set, or sharded cluster configuration
* Binding apps to the instance creates unique credentials for each app to access the database
* Supports deployment of MongoDB Community or Enterprise server

## <a id="reqs"></a>Requirements

Before installing the MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF tile, you must download and install a licensed copy of MongoDB Ops Manager. MongoDB Ops Manager deploys, manages, monitors, and backs up MongoDB servers in your PCF and other environments.
The tile integrates your PCF environment with MongoDB Ops Manager through published REST APIs.

Download MongoDB Ops Manager from [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#ops-manager), and follow the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/installation/) to install it.

A prerequisite for the use of Ops Manager and MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF in production is an Enterprise Advanced Subscription that covers all MongoDB instances.
See the [License](#license) section for more information.

## <a id="limits"></a>Limitations

The MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF has the following limitations:

* Standalone and Replica set plans are pre-configured to one and three nodes respectively.
* It uses only one stemcell.
* Support for creating blank MongoDB agent VMs is not available.
