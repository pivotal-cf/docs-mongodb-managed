This documentation describes the MongoDB Enterprise Service for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).
The MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF tile registers a service broker on PCF and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace.
Those plans are integrated with <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/products/ops-manager">MongoDB Ops Manager</a>.
Developers can provision MongoDB databases by creating instances of the service plans using Apps Manager
or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).
