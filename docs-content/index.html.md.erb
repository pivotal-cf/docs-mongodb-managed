## <a id="reqs"></a>Requirements

Before installing the MongoDB Enterprise Service for VMware Tanzu tile, you must download and install a licensed copy of MongoDB Ops Manager. MongoDB Ops Manager deploys, manages, monitors, and backs up MongoDB servers in your VMware Tanzu and other environments.
The tile integrates your VMware Tanzu environment with MongoDB Ops Manager through published REST APIs.

Download MongoDB Ops Manager from [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#ops-manager), and follow the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/installation/) to install it.

MongoDB Ops Manager is not istalled by the VMware Tanzu Tile and must be provisioned outside of VMware Tanzu Cluster.

A prerequisite for the use of Ops Manager and MongoDB Enterprise Service for VMware Tanzu in production is an Enterprise Advanced Subscription that covers all MongoDB instances.
See the [License](#license) section for more information.
