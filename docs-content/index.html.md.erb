## <a id="reqs"></a>Requirements

Before installing the MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF tile, you must download and install a licensed copy of MongoDB Ops Manager. MongoDB Ops Manager deploys, manages, monitors, and backs up MongoDB servers in your PCF and other environments.
The tile integrates your PCF environment with MongoDB Ops Manager through published REST APIs.

Download MongoDB Ops Manager from [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#ops-manager), and follow the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/installation/) to install it.

MongoDB Ops Manager is not istalled by the Pivotal Platform Tile and must be provisioned outside of Pivotal Platform Cluster.

A prerequisite for the use of Ops Manager and MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF in production is an Enterprise Advanced Subscription that covers all MongoDB instances.
See the [License](#license) section for more information.

## <a id="limits"></a>Limitations

The MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF has the following limitations:

* Standalone and Replica set plans are pre-configured to one and three nodes respectively.
* It uses only one stemcell.
* Support for creating blank MongoDB agent VMs is not available.

* MongoDB Ops Manager functionality and features are limited when used with MongoDB Pivotal Platform Tile.
